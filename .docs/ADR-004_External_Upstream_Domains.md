# ADR 004: Integration of External Upstream Domains for Microservice Migration Readiness

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our system's interaction with a variety of external services and systems is essential for providing comprehensive functionality. However, these interactions can lead to complex and tightly coupled architectures. As we look toward future scalability, it's imperative to prepare our system for a potential migration to a microservices architecture.

## Decision

We will define and integrate "external upstream domains" as distinct domain models that represent the external systems and services our system interacts with. These domains will encapsulate the complexities of these interactions, providing a clean and well-defined interface for our system to communicate with them. This approach is a strategic step in preparing our system for a smooth transition to microservices, allowing for easier extraction of these domains as separate services when the time comes.

## Consequences

This decision will:

- Provide a consistent and isolated domain model for each external service, simplifying integration.
- Reduce the coupling between our system and external services, increasing resilience to changes in external APIs.
- Enhance the maintainability and scalability of our system by clearly separating internal and external logic.
- Lay the groundwork for a future microservice architecture, ensuring that our system is designed with this transition in mind.
